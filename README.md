# Quantum transport simulations of twisted bilayer graphene

## Research goals

In this project, we implement quantum transport simulations of a tight-binding model of twisted bilayer graphene. In particular, we are interested in studying the relation between the energy-resolved conductance and the density of states of twisted bilayer graphene near the first magic angle $\theta_m \approx 1.05^\circ$. 

Objectives and questions:
* Simulate a large mesoscopic device of twisted bilayer graphene attached to four electrodes
* Calculate the spectrum of near-magic angle twisted bilayer graphene
* Calculate the energy-resolved conductance of near-magic angle twisted bilayer graphene at a range of energies that includes the moiré spectrum
* Analyze signatures in the energy-resolved conductance and see if they relate to features in the moiré spectrum.

## Results:
* The results of this work were published in Physical Review Research: https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043145
* We found pronounced peaks in the conductance that align with van Hove singularities in the spectrum
* The conductance depends on the size of the device in a non-trivial way
